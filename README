To me this koding Kata is about design up front. I took a little time
 to think about the data, since I was at the devnology Marktplaats
 event. And I took some pointers from the actual game. 

It is not finished yet. The way ghost hunt for pacman is still clumsy
and I did not spend much time on the user interface because that is
not part of what I found interesing about the problem.

It was not developed in a test driven style.
