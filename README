To me this coding-kata is about design up front. I took a little time
to think about the data representation, since I was present at the
devnology Marktplaats event and I took some pointers from the actual
game.

It is not finished yet. The way ghost hunt for pacman is still
clumsy/wrong and I did not spend much time on the user interface
because that is not part of what I found interesting about the problem.

It was not developed in a test driven. It is closer to a prototype,
since refactoring the design was key to the exercise and tests stand
in the way of that.
